Its a way for having a git repo on another git repo.
It works by copying git commits from the child repo to mother repo. Usually we squash these commits to one root commit, but you may omit that to preserve history of child repo on the mother repo.
Since it copies the commits rather than having pointers. After the copying, the child repo can be destroyed and the mother repo will still have the files and will be fully functional.</description></item></channel></rss>
