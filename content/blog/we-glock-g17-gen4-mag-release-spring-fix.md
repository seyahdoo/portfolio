### Intro

The We Glock G17 Gen 4 has a chronic problem. It sometimes fails to catch the magazine, even if the magazine is fully inserted.
And this will lead to magazines being left on the field and no mag being on the replica while we most need it.
Certainly a dire situation that needs fixing.


### The Problem

The problem certainly arises from the magazine catch spring. If we need that satisfying click and a firm hold on the magazine. 
We need a stronger spring on the magazine catch assembly.

### The Fix

The easiest way of fixing any spring is bending the spring the other way a bit. This is the first thing that I have tried. 
It should be a pretty easy job for any handy person.

### Other Method

I would also consider changing the spring wire entirely for something harder, with the same shape. That would fix it. 
But I havent invested on that possibility yet.
